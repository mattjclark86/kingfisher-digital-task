# Kingfisher Digital - Technical Assessment Task

This is a private GitHub repository for my work on a set technical assessment task by Kingfisher Digital as part of their application process.

Primary modules used in this project:

- Node.js
- React.js
- React-dom
- React-router-dom

The command "npx create-react-app" was used to create a default react app which was then adapted into this current iteration of the project.
